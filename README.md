# Mini Search Engine
A simplified search engine implemented entirely from scratch in Java, designed to demonstrate core computer science concepts such as hash tables, graph traversal, sorting algorithms, and page ranking.

This project simulates how real search engines (like Google) crawl, index, and rank web pages — but using a small, local XML-based “internet”.

## Technologies Used
**Language**: Java \
**Core Concepts**: Data Structures, Algorithms, Graph Theory, Sorting, Hashing
**Parsing**: XML
